## Key advices 
**- What question are you answering :** We are trying to tell a story : a dashboard sheet should be the answer to a question and each graph on it a key argument. If we want to answer multiple question, then we should have multiple sheets (keeping it reasonable).     
**- Less is more :** communicate accurate but easily understandable. Data overload leads to confusion. The dashboard is not a showroom, think of what information your final user needs.  
**- Ask for feedbacks :** You are working non-stop with your data and yourself, you might need a new eye and external point of view on your choice of visual. So ask colleagues that knows not that much about your project for what they understand. If they don't understand anything ask why and apply the changes, don't take it personnaly or what.
