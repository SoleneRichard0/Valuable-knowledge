## Interview with [Peter O'Neil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peteroneill):
#### **Digital analyst** vs **Data analyst**:   
  Strong belief that they are **not** the same.  
  1. One key differenciator is that a big part of the focus of Digital analyst is on **how people think** or on how they **don't** think.  
  1. Also, Web analysis means working with a **huge amount of data**.  
  Don't get it wrong... Not that data analyst don't.  
  But,   
  The datasets used to understand userflow on the website means recording every tracker state for each action, from a click to a slide. It can even be tracking exactly how the users are moving there mouse.  
  The granularity of the data used is then **very low**.
#### "Don't make me think":  
  It does refer to a book but the title describes perfectly the mindset someone working in web developpement or web analysis should think like.  
  It is about trying to think like our end-user if order to offer the best experience on the website.  
  If we push the idea a bit further this motto also work when we present a repport to a client. 
  It should be self-explanatory, else it means that the work could have been done better.

#### Being a Junior: make mistakes!
It is more than normal as a Junior to feel frustrated about **not delivering** that much.  
  What is important is making mistakes, but more importantly, learning from them.  
  It is okay to make a mistake once, undertandable the 2nd time, but maybe the 3rd time is too much *-> it could even lead in loosing your audience's trust*  
    
    
  The biggest difference between senior and junior is the **number of mistakes** they have made, but also the number of situation/experience they have met 
  (allowing them to recognize pattern and undertqnd things faster).  
  
  To avoid *the easily avoidable* mistakes : 
  - Double check your work as much as possible
  - Learn to accept and embrace frustration and mistakes: you'll get better thanks to them
#### Not starting from scratch:
We are working in a field which a lot of **communities**, where people share valuable knowledge.  
So in order to not loose time on things that  have **already been cracked**, some good practises can be used : 
1. Talk with people: colleagues, experts...
2. Read books
3. Listen to podcasts 

#### Do not base everything on your opinion:  

As hard as it is to apply, you are usually wrong, or at least, your opinion is not representative of a big crowd.   
So whenever your are basing your chouces on opinion or hypothesis, test them.   
Only after that you'll be able to take decisions.    
Don't let yourself be fooled by the confirmation bias.   
 
#### One of Peter's personal goal in Decathlon:
Trying to focus on creating process that are **repeatable** and **reliable**:  
The advantage of such a process is that, once it's well defined, it can generate value with a minimum of effort.
