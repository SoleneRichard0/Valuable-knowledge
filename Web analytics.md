## Interview with [Peter O'Neil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peteroneill):
- **Digital analyst** vs **Data analyst**: First, one key differenciator is that the focus of Digital analyst
is mainly on how people think or on how they DON't think. Also Web analysis means working with a huge amount of data,
even if data analysts are, themselves, already working with a huge quantity of data, the granularity of the data used
by web analystist is very small (as in their datasets there is a line for each action of the user, like a click).
- **Don't make me think**: More than being a book, it is a critical rule web analyst should have in mind.
+ example of how he puts it in place
- **Being a Junior**: Itr is more than normal as a Junior to feel frustrated about not delivering that much.
  What is important is making mistakes, but more importantly, learning from them.
  It is okay to make a mistake once, undertandable the 2nd time, but maybe the 3rd time is too much (-> you could loose you audience trust by the way).
  The biggest difference between senior and junior is the number of mistakes they have donc, but also the number of situation/experience they have met.
  To be able to not make avaidable mistake : double check your work as much as possible, and also : learn to accept and embrace frustration and mistakes. 
- **Not starting from scratch**: We are working in a field which a lot of communities, where people share valuable knowledge 
- contact people, read, document etc
- **Confirmation Bias** : try not to use your opinion
- **Create repetable and relible process**:
